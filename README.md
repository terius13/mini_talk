MINITALK 42 PROJECT

Mandatory:
This project is a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
The client sends a string to the server using signals and bit manipulation.
The server receives the string in bits and pieces it together then outputs it to the terminal character by character.

Bonus:
The bonus requires the server to acknowledge the message send by the client by sending back a signal to the client.
I did this and program the client to output a test to the terminal as well.
It also requires the program to be able to output and accept unicode characters(such as emojis) as well, however both my mandatory and bonus are able to do this.

I had alot of fun with this project as it was very interactive!
